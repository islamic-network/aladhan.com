# Al Adhan App

This is the code you see deployed on https://aladhan.com. This documentation explains how you can get setup
to deploy your own instance and contribute code.

## Technology Stack and Requirements
* PHP 8.3
* Composer - See composer.json for other dependencies
* Slim Framework v4
* Bootstrap 3
* JQuery
* Docker

## Getting Started

### Running the App

The app is fully Dockerised. You **just need docker** to spin it up.

A production ready Docker image of the app is published as:

* quay.io/islamic-network/aladhan.com on QUAY
* ghcr.io/islamic-network/aladhan.com on the GitHub Container Registry

To get your own instance up, simply run:

```
docker run -it -p 8082:8080  ghcr.io/islamic-network/aladhan.com:latest
``` 

You can now visit http://localhost:8082/ and start using it.

### Build and Contribute 

**Please note that the Dockerfile included builds a production ready container which has opcache switched on and xdebug turned off, so you will only see your changes every 5 minutes if you are developing. To actively develop, change the ```FROM ghcr.io/islamic-network/php:8.0-apache``` line to ```ghcr.io/islamic-network/php:8.0-apache-dev```.**

1. Clone this repository
2. Run ```docker build . -t ghcr.io/islamic-network/aladhan.com```. This will build an image with production dependencies only.
3. Run ```docker run -it -p 8081:8080  -v $(pwd)/.:/var/www ghcr.io/islamic-network/aladhan.com``` to spin up the built image.
3. Run ```composer install``` to add development dependencies.
6. Make sure you have internet connectivity so the app can connect to https://api.aladhan.com.
7. Open your browser and browse to http://localhost:8081/.
8. Any changes you make will be synced to the Docker container. You just refresh the page in the browser to see them.

## Scaling and Sizing

This app takes 37 MB per apache process / worker and is set to have a maximum of 10 Apache workers.

A single instance should be sized with a maximum of 400 MB RAM, after which you should scale it horizontally.

## To test against a local running API

Build the container and run:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/.:/var/www -e API_BASE_URI=http://host.docker.internal --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway <<containername>>
```

## Contributing Code

You can contribute code by raising a pull request.

There's a backlog of stuff under issues for things that potentially need to be worked on, so please feel free to pick something up from there or contribute your own improvements.
